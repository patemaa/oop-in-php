    //Class defines the overall structure and behaviour for a concept in our codebase.
    //Classes => blueprints
    //Objects => implementations
    //Class names should start with capital letters.
    //There's no rule saying that the name of the class have to be a noun, but in general we use nouns.
    //For methods, we are looking for verbs.
    //When we are giving a name to the classes/methods, even its embarrassing we should say it loud so we can decide the best name for that class/method.
